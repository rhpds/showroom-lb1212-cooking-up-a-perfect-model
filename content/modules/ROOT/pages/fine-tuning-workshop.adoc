//— Overview
[[overview]]
== Overview

Fine‑tuning a large language model involves adapting a pre‑trained model by further training it on new, task‑specific data. This allows the model to produce more relevant, accurate, and context‑aware outputs that align precisely with enterprise‑specific use cases.

InstructLab simplifies this complex process by providing a structured, taxonomy‑guided synthetic data generation (SDG) method. The SDG process leverages a teacher model to generate high‑quality synthetic data based on carefully curated enterprise documents and custom‑prepared seed examples (`qna.yaml`). This data then becomes the training set to fine‑tune foundation models, such as the Mistral 7B Instruct, to address specialized tasks with enhanced precision and context‑awareness.

== How InstructLab Helps Align Models

InstructLab addresses critical limitations in general‑purpose foundation models, particularly their inherent lack of domain‑specific expertise and tendency to hallucinate incorrect information.

To tackle these issues, InstructLab uses a multi‑phase training and synthetic data generation strategy that deeply aligns the model with enterprise‑specific knowledge and skills.

//— Taxonomy‑Driven Data Curation
[[taxonomy]]
== Taxonomy‑Driven Data Curation

Effective alignment begins with clearly structured data. InstructLab employs a taxonomy‑driven approach, organizing enterprise‑specific information into a logical, hierarchical folder structure. This taxonomy consists of distinct categories—foundational skills (e.g., math, writing), compositional skills (e.g., extraction from technical manuals), and specialized knowledge areas (e.g., historical texts).

By structuring data in a clear, hierarchical format and pairing it with precise question‑and‑answer examples (`qna.yaml`), the synthetic data generation process is guided precisely, ensuring the produced training dataset closely mirrors your enterprise’s unique needs.

//— Large‑Scale Synthetic Data Generation
[[sdg]]
== Large‑Scale Synthetic Data Generation

To effectively fine‑tune models, you need extensive, high‑quality training data. InstructLab automates this step through its synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline, significantly expanding your training datasets based on initial Q&A seed examples.

Leveraging powerful teacher models, this pipeline generates additional, highly relevant synthetic Q&A data automatically, greatly reducing manual labor and accelerating dataset creation.

//— Model Training with New Data
[[model-training]]
== Model Training with New Data

Once synthetic data is curated and generated, InstructLab utilizes phased, large‑scale alignment tuning—training your model iteratively in multiple stages, first on general knowledge and then refining it with specialized enterprise skills. This structured training approach ensures models not only understand broad concepts but can also perform specific, nuanced tasks effectively.

//— The Value in Enterprise Data
[[enterprise-data-value]]
== The Value in Enterprise Data

It is estimated that only about 1% of enterprise data is represented in popular large language models. This minimal coverage significantly restricts the models' capability to understand and interact meaningfully within specific organizational contexts.

Incorporating enterprise data into pre‑trained models through techniques like Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine‑tuning can significantly improve domain‑specific document analysis, procedural analysis, pattern diagnosis, and more.

== Curating the InstructLab Taxonomy & Best Practices

Effective taxonomy curation is foundational to achieving optimal results when using InstructLab. The taxonomy serves as the backbone for data organization, impacting the synthetic data generation pipeline and subsequent fine‑tuning processes.

* **Domain Identification:** Define your domain (e.g., cybersecurity) and keep taxonomy content within scope.
* **Seed Data Preparation (`qna.yaml`):** Use explicit context snippets verbatim from source documents, paired with diverse Q&A examples.
* **Data Diversity:** Reflect different content types—definitions, procedures, tables—to generate robust synthetic data.
* **Token Management:** Keep context + Q&A near ~750 tokens (~550 words) to avoid input limits.
