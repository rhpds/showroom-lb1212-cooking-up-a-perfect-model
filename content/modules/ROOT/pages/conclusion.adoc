Congratulations — you’ve just customized a large language model for a specific enterprise use case using open source tools!

In this lab, you:

* Structured your domain data using a taxonomy
* Created seed data and expanded it with synthetic Q&A
* Fine-tuned a foundation model
* Evaluated the model using test prompts
* Integrated it into a real application

This workflow is fully portable — you can use it for any domain, from finance to education to healthcare. Best of all, *you own the model and the data*.
