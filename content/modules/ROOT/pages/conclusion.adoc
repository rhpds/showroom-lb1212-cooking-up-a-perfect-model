:page-description: Key takeaways and next steps

Congratulations — you’ve just guided an open‑source foundation model from generic to domain‑expert, crafting a customer‑service assistant that truly "knows" Parasol Airlines. Along the way, you:

* Translated internal policies into a living taxonomy that serves as the backbone for model knowledge  
* Crafted targeted seed Q&A examples and leveraged InstructLab’s synthetic data pipeline to amplify those insights at scale  
* Baked that dataset into a foundation model and served the model locally, in a private and secure environment
* Validated accuracy and alignment through real‑world prompts, catching and correcting model gaps before they reach customers
* Embedded your custom model into the Parasol Airlines demo app for end‑to‑end testing in a realistic UI  

This workflow—taxonomy → synthetic Q&A → fine‑tuning → validation → integration—is your portable blueprint for any industry challenge. You now own both the data and the model, giving you total control over updates, compliance, and feature expansion.

== What’s next?

As you continue your AI Engineering journey, you can keep building your LLM expertise with these steps:

. **Scale your synthetic data**: Increase your SDG scale factor and experiment with advanced pipelines (e.g., multi‑phase or batch generation) to deepen model understanding.  
. **Expand taxonomy coverage**: Add new domains—loyalty programs, incident response, seasonal promotions—to broaden your model’s skill set.  
. **Blend RAG + Fine‑Tuning**: Implement a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation layer to surface dynamic knowledge (flight statuses, real‑time alerts) alongside your fine‑tuned core.  
. **Productionize on RHEL AI**: Migrate your prototype to Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI, leveraging enterprise‑grade monitoring, scaling, and support.  
. **Contribute upstream**: Share your taxonomy improvements, synthetic pipelines, and best practices with the InstructLab community on GitHub—help others learn and iterate faster.
